## Lectures & courses

I also offer lectures and courses. For example, topics might be:

* Data science: Statistics without thinking?
* Introduction to R Programming
* Introduction to the tidyverse
* Curse of Dimensionality, P-hacking, and Other Common Statistical Pitfalls
* Statistics without data? --- What do you do with gaps in your data?
* Unsupervised Clustering and Meta-analysis using Gaussia Mixture Copula Models
* Fused Ridge Estimation of Multiple Inverse Class Covariance Matrices from High-Dimensional Data

I can of course do tailor-made courses or lectures for statistical methods and software packages that I have developed and been involved in. Should you have any doubts or have any other specific requests, please contact me.
